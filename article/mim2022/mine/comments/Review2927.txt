Reviewer 2 of MIM 2022 submission 504

Comments to the author
======================

The problem is interesting, but the paper is poorly written
and not detailed enough regarding the scientific
contributions. The authors suggest to use GTSP algorithms
to solve the GSCCP, the conversation is explained in a very
brief way on an example, and it is difficult to understand
how to generalize it... The methods used are from the
literature.


Avoid using several acronyms, the paper should be rewritten
in a more simplified way.  The real contribution of the
paper is not highlighted enough, is it the conversion of
GTSP to GSCCP (in this case describe in a more formal and
general way this part).The results of the methods are
difficult to interpret since these method have not been
described.  A formalization of the problem is required to
better understand the position of the research.
