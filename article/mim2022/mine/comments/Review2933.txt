Reviewer 5 of MIM 2022 submission 504

Comments to the author
======================

1. The paper does not explain how one can use the algorithm
of PCGTSP to solve GSCCP nor explain how to transform a
GSCCP to a PCGTSP.
2. Some more details and review on the DP and PCGLNS in the
main algorithm will be beneficial to the reader.
3. The experiment is run on only 3 instances, and all of
them are closely related. So it would be interesting to see
how the two algorithms are compared on other different
instances.
