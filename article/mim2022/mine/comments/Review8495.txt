Reviewer 6 of MIM 2022 submission 504

Comments to the author
======================

Dear Authors,
This submission discusses algorithms for solving
generalized segment continuous cutting problems. I found
especially the numerical experiments and discussions well
organized and show scientific contribution. However, I
think it would be better to better describe the proposed
algorithms before the numerical experiments to help the
readers to get better understanding.
Best Regards,
