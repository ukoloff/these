Comments to the author
======================

Dear Authors,
This submission proposes a modeling approach of thermal
sheet cutting of figured parts. The introduction section
provides the background and motivation of the study,
followed by a short summarization of relevant studies.
After that, the problem and solution were well presented
followed by computational experiments and conclusions. I
find the results and conclusions well grounded and provides
useful information for future studies also.
Best Regards,
