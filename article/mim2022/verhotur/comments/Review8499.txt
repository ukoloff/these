Review MIM 0738
Simulating Thermal Sheet Cutting of Figured Parts

The paper is very technical and I miss the “management”
part.
It seems to be not perfectly fitting to MIM aim and scope. 
The paper needs proof reading. 

IFAC guidelines need to be maintained. 

The motivation of the work should be improved in the
introduction.

Better position this work and its contribution in Section 1
as there is no separate literature review section. 

It is not clear how this work extends the state of
knowledge. A specific research gap should be elaborated. 

Use more recent references.

Use the remaining space to better explain the results and
highlight the implications of this work for research and
managers in the conclusion. 

Check the title of this work in the papercept system, here
is written “plates by means of photodiodes. Procedia CIRP,
94, 499–504“, which is very confusing.
