\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:summary}

In this paper,
we designed and implemented
the first problem-specific branch-and-bound
algorithm for precedence constrained GTSP.
The algorithm evolves ideas of the classic DP scheme of Held and Karp
and Salman's framework.

To evaluate performance of the proposed algorithms,
we carried out numerical experiments
in comparison with Gurobi solver
which show that our algorithms appear
to be quite competitive with
state-of-the-art MIP-solver.

To the future work we postpone
design of more tight lower bounds.
In addition, we believe that
further optimization and parallelization
can significantly speed up 
the implementation of our algorithms.
